            "5. Muscle spindles are stretch receptors found throughout virtually every striated muscle in the body and provide information about muscle length and muscle tension.\n",
            "6. Pain signals can be separated into individual components, corresponding to different types of nerve fibers used for transmitting these signals. The rapidly transmitted signal, which often has high spatial resolution, is called first pain or cutaneous pricking pain.\n",

They are composed of a few small muscle fibers with a capsule surrounding the middle third of the fibers. These fibers are called intrafusal fibers, in contrast to the ordinary extrafusal fibers. The ends of the intrafusal fibers are attached to extrafusal fibers, so when the muscle is stretched, the intrafusal fibers are also stretched.\n",

            "Muscle spindles are responsible for providing information about the length and velocity of muscles, which is essential for motor control and proprioception. They are innervated by two types of motor neurons: alpha motor neurons, which supply extrafusal muscle fibers, and gamma motor neurons, which regulate the sensitivity of muscle spindles.\n",
